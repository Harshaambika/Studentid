## **Project Description**

This project is a decentralized Student ID Registration system built on the Flare Coston2 test network.  
It allows any student to securely register their name, age, and course on the blockchain and instantly receive a verifiable on-chain **Student ID**.

The system is fully decentralized — data is stored on-chain, verifiable publicly, and cannot be modified or faked. The UI is built using Next.js, Wagmi, and Viem for seamless wallet-based interaction.

## **How It Solves Real Problems**

Many institutions struggle with identity verification and data authenticity. Physical ID cards can be easily lost or duplicated, while centralized databases are vulnerable to manipulation or breaches.

This project solves these issues by:

### 🔹 **Ensuring Authenticity**  
Each student ID is linked to a unique wallet address and stored immutably on the blockchain.

### 🔹 **Eliminating Fake IDs**  
Since data is public and verified on-chain, it cannot be forged or manipulated.

### 🔹 **Borderless Accessibility**  
Students can present their blockchain ID anywhere without needing physical documents.

### 🔹 **Decentralized Storage**  
No central authority controls student data — users fully own their identity records.

### 🔹 **Easy Integration for Institutions**  
Universities or platforms can read student details directly from the smart contract and verify authenticity instantly.
